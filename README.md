# ðŸ§­ Where Was I


A Chrome extension that remembers your search sessions and captures context when you close a tab.

## Problem

Modern web browsing often involves juggling multiple tabs, searching for information, and switching contexts frequently. It's easy to lose track of what you were doing, especially if you accidentally close a tab or need to restart your browser. Most browsers only restore the last closed tab, but they don't remember the context of your search, the purpose of your visit, or the connections between your tabs. This can lead to lost productivity, repeated searches, and frustration when trying to resume your work or research.

## Solution

"Where Was I" addresses this problem by automatically capturing your search sessions and the context of your browsing when you close a tab. The extension keeps a record of your recent searches, visited pages, and the context in which you were working. When you return, you can easily review your previous sessions, understand what you were working on, and pick up right where you left off. This helps you stay organized, reduces the time spent retracing your steps, and makes your browsing experience more efficient and less stressful.
