## What it does

Where Was I watches your browsing and, when a tab is closed, it saves the tab‚Äôs title, URL, favicon, and metadata. Tabs are auto-grouped into ‚Äúsessions‚Äù. These sessions are summarized with AI so you can quickly recall what you were doing and jump back in.

From the **Dashboard**, you can:
**
- Browse your sessions in Timeline, List, or Sessions views
- Find across titles, URLs, and summaries
- Edit session titles, remove tabs, and move tabs between sessions
- Session sorting and filtering
- Export/Import data as JSON for backup or sharing
**
**Privacy**

All data is stored locally in your browser. No servers used.
