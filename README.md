## What it does

Where Was I watches your browsing and, when a tab is closed, it saves the tab‚Äôs title, URL, favicon, and metadata. Tabs are auto-grouped into ‚Äúsessions‚Äù. These sessions are summarized with AI so you can quickly recall what you were doing and jump back in.

From the Dashboard, you can:

- Browse your sessions in Timeline, List, or Sessions views
- Search using natural language across titles, URLs, and summaries
- Edit session titles, remove tabs, and move tabs between sessions
- Session sorting and filtering
- Export/Import data as JSON for backup or sharing

**Privacy**

All data is stored locally in your browser. No servers used.

## How it works

- Background service worker listens for tab close events and persists data to Chrome storage.
- The Dashboard (a Vite + React app) reads from storage and provides multiple views, along with session management, search, sorting and filtering.
- When the tab is closed, the service worker searches for a suitable session to group the tab into using **Gemini** AI.
- It creates a new session if no suitable one is found.
- The session title is generated when a new session is closed using **Gemini**.
- Session details (title and summary) is updated when a new tab is added, making it more versatile and accurate.
- The AI summary of the session is generated by **Chrome's built-in AI: Summarizer AI**.
